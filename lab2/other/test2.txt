I could certainly use new clothes right now, but it better be magic items or I swear I'm never doing a damned bonus task again. Well. It wasnâ€™t the hard part of the trial but still.

Sofia closed the blinds and locked the door. The night was cold in the cabin, she fed two more logs to the fireplace, it was the only source of heat and light.

"Should I get naked?" she wondered out loud, reminiscing over what Drakron's guildmaster had taught them. The process of leveling up through a filter was very painful as it involved the system forcing your whole body to upgrade at once. Usually a level up was a simple gradual tempering of the body, when this reached its limit the system would be unable to upgrade you anymore without a complete and intricate overhaul of your body. No matter if you were a Human or a Dragon, everyone would need to go through it.

This whole thing sounded a lot like it would go better without clothes getting in the way. Also she only had that one set of pajamas and she actually liked them. Wouldn't want to ruin them, it's already kinda tight, they might rip if I move too much.

There was no one to see her here anyway.

She waited on the bed.

Everything's going to be alright. Can't be worse than a demonic rebirth. For sure.
